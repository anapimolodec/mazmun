This is a personal portfolio built with React.

## 🚀 Feel free to download the repository and give some stars!

  **but please do not copy sentences or any of my projects**


## 🧐 What's inside?

``` home.js``` page
- Very simple homepage of the portfolio with contact links and 3D oyu [kazakh traditional ornament].

``` main.js``` page

``` project_page.js``` page
- Individual project page

## Relevant glossary
```mazmun``` means "short summary" in Kazakh, which is basically how I would describe this portfolio, a short summary of my front end development journey
```oyu``` means "ornament or pattern" in Kazakh, which is so pretty I cannot not include it here
